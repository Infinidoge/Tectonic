# Tectonic
Tectonic is a lightweight annotation-based read-only YAML configuration API written in Java with a powerful abstraction
system, and extensive support for custom type loaders.  

Tectonic allows you to easily create and load YAML configurations, with extensive support for abstraction, greatly
reducing boilerplate within similar configs. Tectonic is useful for data-driven applications in which users may be
creating many very similar configurations.

Tectonic is the base of [Terra's](https://github.com/PolyhedralDev/Terra) extensive config system.
